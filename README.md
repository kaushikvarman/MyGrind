# MyGrind

Hi There,


I’m Kaushik. I completed my masters in CS in may2023. Since then I’ve been working very hard to get a full time job. Built a complete end-end ecommerce website. Learned AWS Cloud and completed a certification. Started learning SQL and solved 400+ problems. Started learning SnowFlake but didn’t have enough money to attempt certification. Started learning Azure Databricks with PySpark. Completed learning spark theory. Started learning data modeling. 

I used to spend most of the time applying for jobs. Probably I may have applied around 800+, but all I received was rejection mails. Still even after so many rejections I stay myself motivated.

Currently I have started a grind series to show you guys my consistency and discipline.

Bleary-eyed but determined, Kaushik woke up before dawn, another day spent pounding the pavement. Every rejection was a stepping stone, every interview a hard-won victory.


Sincerely, <br>
Kaushik
